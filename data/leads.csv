Yaqub Qamar Ad Din Dibiazah,Director Engineering,Imaarat Tech,50-100,Engineering,CentDoc,"In the past, the company encountered an issue where their product manuals became out of sync with the software documentation. As the development teams continued to add new features and refine existing ones, they also updated the documentation. However, this required manual synchronization between the product manuals and the software documentation.

To address this problem, the company has envisioned a solution called ""CentDoc"". This tool will automatically detect any inconsistencies between the product manuals and software documentation. It will then remove outdated information from the manuals using the software documentation, but only after receiving explicit approval from the user.",Thanks for reaching out. Our procurement team is actively looking for potential consultants. Can you please get in touch with them at procure@centdoc.io
